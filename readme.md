# Strandbeest 3D Simulation

This project is a 3D simulation of a Strandbeest, inspired by Theo Jansen's wind-powered mechanical creatures. It utilizes Three.js for rendering and Rapier for physics simulation to create an interactive and visually appealing experience.

**Key Features:**

- **Modular Scene Setup:** Well-structured code with separated components for scene, lighting, terrain, and more, enhancing maintainability and organization.
- **Realistic Terrain:** A textured plane with height variations to simulate uneven, sandy ground.
- **Dynamic Lighting and Shadows:** Ambient and directional lights with shadow mapping to add depth and realism to the scene.
- **Jansen Linkage Mechanics:** Simulation of Strandbeest legs using rods and joints based on the Jansen linkage principle.
- **Physics-Based Movement:** Rapier physics engine for realistic gravity, collisions, and constrained motion of the Strandbeest.
- **Development Environment:** Vite bundler for efficient module management and a clear folder structure for project clarity.

**File Structure:**

```bash
src/components/  # Three.js components for scene elements
src/utils/       # Utility functions and modules
index.html       # Main HTML file
vite.config.js   # Vite configuration file
```

**Project Goal:**

To create a visually engaging and interactive simulation of a Strandbeest walking on a sandy terrain, driven by physics and rendered in 3D using Three.js.
